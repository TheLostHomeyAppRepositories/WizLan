APP for Wiz Connected devices controlled inside the local network
WizLan adds support for Wiz Connected devices such as light bulbs, lamps, LED strips and Power Sockets. 
The devices' recognition is not based on the type of device, but on which functionality the device has (dimmable, white color adjustable, color etc.). 
Therefore, most light devices from Wiz should be supported. In addition, there is support for smart plugs with and without current measurement.
WizLan is based entirely on local communication within your own local Wi-Fi network so that you avoid the additional vulnerability of a cloud service api.
The app has been tested with some newer types of light bulbs from Philips Wiz, 
but support from these cannot be guaranteed in all local networks as they seem slower than light bulbs supplied by Wiz Connected.
